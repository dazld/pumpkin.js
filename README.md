Pumpkin.js
==========

(this is not being maintained, was more of a set of ideas that didn't really take flight)

(emphasis) Work in progress (emphasis) client side single-page JS framework, that tries to tie together a number of 
'standard' components. Learning exercise, basically.

Core:
- App (Module Lifecycle, Rendering)
- Module (does stuff either in the DOM as a Layout module, or just arbitrarily as a Core extension)

Includes and takes as a given:

- Handlebars
- Postal.js
- Require.js
- JQuery
- Underscore

This is probably a lot of dependencies for general use - but it's a standard set of tools which gives a ton
of functionality.


Inspiration:

- Backbone
- CodeIgniter <3
